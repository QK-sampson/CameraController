What I want my Camera script to do:

1. Control my DSLR though GPhoto2 commands.

2. Take a timelapse photo series.

3. Trigger the camera to take a picture using the Raspberry Pi motion sensor.

4. Use error handling for any cases where the camera does not take a store the image for any reason.

5. Have built-in tests to verify each of these functions. (According to TDD the code writing should start with the tests.)
