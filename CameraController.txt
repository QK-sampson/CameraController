What I want my Camera script to do:

1. Control my DSLR though GPhoto2 commands. --done

2. Take a timelapse photo series. --done

3. Trigger the camera to take a picture using the Raspberry Pi motion sensor.

4. Use error handling for any cases where the camera does not take a store the image for any reason. --partially done

5. Have built-in tests to verify each of these functions. (According to TDD the code writing should start with the tests.)

6. New idea: Upload photos to Dropbox as they are taken. I have installed the dropbox package for Python, and next need to read the tutorial and documentation to learn how to use it.
