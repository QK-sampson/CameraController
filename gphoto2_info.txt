DESCRIPTION
       libgphoto2(3) is a cross-platform digital camera library, and
       gphoto2(1) is a command-line client for it.

       Where an option takes a RANGE of files, thumbnails, or other data, they
       are numbered beginning at 1. A range is a comma-separated list of
       numbers or spans (“first-last”). Ranges are XOR (exclusive or), so that
       “1-5,3,7” is equivalent to “1,2,4,5,7”.

       --debug
           Turn on debugging output. Debugging output is written to stderr by
           default, or to the filename given to the --debug-logfile option.

       --debug-logfile FILENAME (since 2.3.0)
           The logfile to write the debugging info to, if --debug is given.

       --hook-script FILENAME (new after 2.3.0)
           Execute the hook script FILENAME every time a certain event happens
           within gphoto2. The hook script reads the environment variable
           ACTION. It must ignore ACTION values unknown to it.

           ACTION=init

               gphoto2 has just been initialized. If the hook script returns
               with a non-zero exit code now, gphoto2 will abort.

           ACTION=start

               gphoto2 has just finished parsing the command line and is about
               to start executing the commands given on the command line.

           ACTION=download

               gphoto2 has just downloaded a file to the computer, storing it
               in the file indicated by the environment variable ARGUMENT.

           ACTION=stop

               gphoto2 is about to finish. Do your final cleanups here.

           All other environment variables are passed to the hook script
           unchanged. You can make use of that to pass data to the hook
           script.

           Hook script may be specified in the ~/.gphoto/settings file as
           gphoto2=hook-script=filename.

       -q, --quiet
           Quiet output (default=verbose).

       -v, --version
           Display version and exit.

       -h, --help
           Display a short usage message.

       --list-cameras
           List supported camera models.

       --list-ports
           List supported port devices.

       --stdout
           Send file to stdout.

       --stdout-size
           Print filesize before data.

       --auto-detect
           List auto-detected cameras and the ports to which they are
           connected.

       --port PATH
           Specify port device. The --list-ports prints a list of valid,
           usable ports. In case of multiple USB cameras, the --auto-detect
           shows you the specific port each camera is connected to.

       --speed SPEED
           Specify serial transfer speed.

       --camera MODEL
           Specify camera model. The --list-cameras option prints a list of
           all explicitly supported cameras.

           Most model names contain spaces: remember to enclose the name in
           quotes so that the shell knows it is one parameter. For example:
           --camera "Kodak DC240".

           Note that if you specify --camera, you must also specify --port.
           Otherwise the --camera option will be silently ignored.

       --filename FILENAME
           When downloading files from the camera, specify the file name or
           file name pattern to use when storing the downloaded file on the
           local disk. When uploading a file to the camera, specify the
           filename to store the uploaded file as on the camera.

           The --filename option accepts %a, %A, %b, %B, %d, %H, %k, %I, %l,
           %j, %m, %M, %S, %y, %%, (see date(1)) and, in addition, %n for the
           number, %C for the filename suffix, %f for the filename without
           suffix, %: for the complete filename in lowercase.

           Note that %: is still in alpha stage, and the actual character or
           syntax may still be changed. E.g. it might be possible to use %#f
           and %#C for lower case versions, and %^f and %^C for upper case
           versions.

           %n is the only conversion specifier to accept a padding character
           and width: %03n will pad with zeros to width 3 (e.g. print the
           number 7 as “007”). Leaving out the padding character (e.g. %3n)
           will use an implementation specific default padding character which
           may or may not be suitable for use in file names.

           Default value for this option can be specified in the
           ~/.gphoto/settings file as gphoto2=filename=value.

       --usbid USBIDS
           (Expert only) Override USB IDs.
            USBIDSmust be of the form
            DetectedVendorID:DetectedProductID=TreatAsVendorID:TreatAsProductID
           to treat any USB device detected as
           DetectedVendorID:DetectedProductID as
           TreatAsVendorID:TreatAsProductID instead. All the VendorIDs and
           ProductIDs should be hexadecimal numbers beginning in C notation,
           i.e. beginning with ´0x´.

           Example: --usbid 0x4a9:0x306b=0x4a9:0x306c

       -a, --abilities
           Display camera abilities.

       -f, --folder FOLDER
           Specify camera folder (default="/").

       -R, --recurse
           Recursion (default for download).

       --no-recurse
           No recursion (default for deletion).

       -l, --list-folders
           List folders in folder.

       -L, --list-files
           List files in folder.

       -m, --mkdir NAME
           Create a directory.

       -r, --rmdir NAME
           Remove a directory.

       -n, --num-files
           Display number of files.

       -p, --get-file RANGE
           Get files given in range.

       -P, --get-all-files
           Get all files from folder.

       -t, --get-thumbnail RANGE
           Get thumbnails given in range.

       -T, --get-all-thumbnails
           Get all thumbnails from folder.

       --get-raw-data RANGE
           Get raw data given in range.

       --get-all-raw-data
           Get all raw data from folder.

       --get-audio-data RANGE
           Get audio data given in range.

       --get-all-audio-data
           Get all audio data from folder.

       --force-overwrite
           Overwrite files without asking.

       --new
           Only get not already downloaded files. This option depends on
           camera support of flagging already downloaded images and is not
           available for all drivers.

       -d, --delete-file RANGE
           Delete files given in range.

       -D, --delete-all-files
           Delete all files in folder (defaults to --no-recurse).

       -u, --upload-file FILENAME
           Upload a file to camera.

       --capture-preview
           Capture a quick preview.

       -F COUNT, --frames COUNT
           Number of frames to capture in one run. Default is infinite number
           of frames.

       -I SECONDS, --interval SECONDS
           Time between capture of multiple frames.

           (Since 2.4) If SIGUSR1 signal is received, a picture is taken
           immediately without waiting for the end of the current interval
           period (see the section called “SIGNALS”). A value of -1 will let
           gphoto2 wait forever, i.e. until a signal arrives. See also
           --reset-interval (since 2.4).

       --reset-interval (since 2.4)
           Setting this option will reset the time interval to the value given
           by the -I|--interval option when a SIGUSR1 signal is received in
           time-lapse mode.

       --capture-image
           Capture an image and keep it on the camera.

       --capture-image-and-download
           Capture an image and download it immediately to the computer.

       --capture-movie
           Capture a movie. (No driver supports this at this time.)

       --capture-sound
           Capture an audio clip.

       --capture-tethered
           Lets gphoto2 wait for notifications from the camera that an object
           was added. This is useful for tethered capture, where pressing the
           shutter on the camera immediately transfer the image to the machine
           for processing.

           Together with the --hook-script to immediately postprocess or
           display the images this can help a studio workflow.

           This option requires support in the driver and by the camera,
           currently newer Canon EOS and Nikon DSC are known to work.

       --wait-event SECONDS or COUNT, --wait-event-and-download SECONDS or
       COUNT
           Lets gphoto2 wait for notifications from the camera for various
           things. This is useful for seeing what the camera does and waiting
           for objects to be added. The objects are kept on camera in the
           “--wait-event” version, with “--wait-event-and-download” they are
           downloaded.

           --wait-event-and-download is equivalent to --capture-tethered.

           The time to wait can be either specified as full seconds with a "s"
           suffix, or as a number of events (just a number). If nothing
           happens, a timeout is generated after 1 second, so a “wait-event=5”
           will take at most 5 seconds. A “--wait-event=5s” will take exactly
           5 second.

           If no argument is given, the wait time is 1 million events
           (basically forever).

           In the download variant this can be used together with the
           --hook-script to immediately postprocess or display the images this
           can help a studio workflow.

           This option requires support in the driver and by the camera,
           currently newer Canon EOS and Nikon DSC are known to work.

       --show-info RANGE
           Show info.

       --list-config
           List all configuration entries.

       --get-config CONFIGENTRY
           Get the specified configuration entry.

           This command will list the type, the current value and also the
           available options of this configuration value.

       --set-config CONFIGENTRY=CONFIGVALUE
           Set the specified configuration entry. For lists of choices of
           values this setting first looks up CONFIGVALUE as value and then as
           index into the choice list. Since this is not fully clear, you can
           use --set-config-index or --set-config-value to be more clear what
           is searched for.

           Look at the output of --get-config to see what values are possible
           to set here.

       --set-config-index CONFIGENTRY=CONFIGINDEX
           Set the specified configuration entry by specifying the index into
           the list of choices for the configuration value. This of course
           only works for configuration settings that offer list of choices.

           Look at the output of --get-config to see what indices are possible
           to set here.

       --set-config-value CONFIGENTRY=CONFIGVALUE
           Set the specified configuration entry by specifying its new value.
           For lists of choices the value is looked up and set.

           Look at the output of --get-config to see what indices are possible
           to set here.

       --storage-info
           Display information about the camera´s storage media.

       --summary
           Summary of camera status.

       --manual

       set-config-index NAME=VALUE
           Sets the configuration specified by “NAME” to the “INDEX” into the
           list of choices. Works only for Menu or Radio button entries.

       wait-event COUNT or SECONDS
           Waits for events from the camera for the specified time in SECONDS
           (if suffixed with s) or the COUNT of events from the camera, where
           every seconds a timeout event happens. Newly added images are kept
           on the camera.

           every seconds a timeout event happens. Newly added images are
           downloaded from the camera.

           Default is 1 event.

       help, ?
           Displays command usage.

       exit, quit, q
           Exit the gphoto2 shell.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       CAMLIBS
           If set, defines the directory where the libgphoto2 library looks
           for its camera drivers (camlibs). You only need to set this on OS/2
           systems and broken/test installations.

       IOLIBS
           If set, defines the directory where the libgphoto2_port library
           looks for its I/O drivers (iolibs). You only need to set this on
           OS/2 systems and broken/test installations.

       LD_DEBUG
           Set this to all to receive lots of debug information regarding
           library loading on ld based systems.

       USB_DEBUG
           If set, defines the numeric debug level with which the libusb
           library will print messages. In order to get some debug output, set
           it to 1.

SIGNALS
       SIGUSR1 (since 2.4)
           In time-lapse capture mode, receiving a SIGUSR1 signal makes
           gphoto2 take a picture immediately.

           If the --reset-interval option is given, the time counter is reset
           to the value given by the -I|--interval option. Note that the
           camera will need some time (from 50ms to a few seconds) to actually
           capture the image.

EXAMPLES
       gphoto2 --list-ports
           Shows what kinds of ports (USB and serial) you have.

       gphoto2 --auto-detect
           Shows what camera(s) you have connected.

       gphoto2 --list-files
           List files on camera.

       gphoto2 --get-file 7-13
           Get files number 7 through 13 from the list output by gphoto2
           --list-files.

       gphoto2 --capture-image --interval 60 --hook-script
       /usr/share/doc/gphoto2/test-hook.sh
           Capture one image every 60 seconds from now to eternity. The
           example hook script will be called after each captured image has
           been stored on the computer.

       To track down errors, you can add the --debug parameter to the gphoto2
       command line and, if dealing with USB problems, setting the environment
       variable USB_DEBUG=1.
